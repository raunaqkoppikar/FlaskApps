# flaskapps
This repository stores all my work in Flask
This particular project deals with CRUD operations w.r.t a customer database through front-end. 

Basically, it is a full stack application which deals with addition, deletion, update and retrieval of customers.

This is my first attempt at full stack development using Python (via Flask framework), HTML, CSS and SQLITE, along with virtual 
environments.

The customer_db folder has a folder named src, which stores my code for the project.
Within src folder, the templates folder contains html files, and the static folder contains the referenced css files for the layout.

In addition, you will also find two .py files, one for creating the database and the other for performing CRUD operations on the customers 
table in the database
